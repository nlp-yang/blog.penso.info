Sprint workflow


####

What matters to me is being able to know how productive the team is, and what
velocity we get. It allows me to be accurate about what gets done, and about
how long it will take to be done on future tasks, even with an error margin.

If you don't know your team velocity, you're in complete darkness. However, to
know your team velocity, you must have everything done filled up in Pivotal (or
whatever tool you are using). When I say everything, I mean everything,
including what was not planned the day before.

What matters isn't to make sure Engineers spent 8 hours of their day working on
coding, it's how much work/points/features are completed per week, and how long
it will take to develop your backlog.

##### How you think it works

1. You ask Engineers to work on feature A, B and C. You planned those features
with them, it's supposed to take 5 days.
2. Your Engineers work on them
3. 5 days later, it's delivered

##### How it works in the Real World

1. It's Monday, you ask Engineers to work on feature A, B and C. You didn't
actually plan anything with them, but you expect it will take 3 days, therefor
those features should be done by next Thursday.
2. Product Manager B ask one of your Engineer to work on 'that little thing'
without having previously talked to you *(Product Manager A)*, your Engineer
thinks he will take him 4 hours work, start working on it for being nice. It
ends up being 2 days of work, it delays his work queue.
3. What you thought should take 3 days takes 5 days full time of work, because
you didn't plan those with your Engineers.
4. The 2 days of work your Engineer spent on another hidden feature for helping
Product Manager B aren't listed anywhere, you think your Engineers aren't as
effective as they really are.

Bottom line: Everything Engineers are working on should be filled up
somewhere. **Everything**. For Engineers feeling they can do that, you must
never sermon them for doing work they are not supposed to be. If they are
working on something, trust them about the fact it's important. The upside of
having Engineers filling up all they're working on is higher than the downside
of having them working on other stuff, which they would have worked on
*anyway*.
