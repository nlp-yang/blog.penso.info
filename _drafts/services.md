I don't like to pay for online services, unless I have to. Here is some I'm
actually paying:

1. [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/): A delicious replacement, I paid once when
registering. It's my bookmarks, it's fast, it's efficient.
2. [flickr](http://flickr.com): I'm not sure I'll keep paying for this, but I
was one of the user with recurrent payment.
3. [Giganews](http://www.giganews.com/): The world's longest Usenet retention
with over 110,000 newsgroups. 1759 days of binary retention and more than 8.5
years of text retention.
