I worked the past months on <a href="http://faast.io/">Faast</a>, a
<a href="http://faast.io">real-time RSS reader</a> for your iOS7 devices.
It has finally been approved on the Appstore (close to a month waiting! I was
expecting it to be rejected...). I would be lying if I wasn't telling you my
adrenaline raised just reading the subject Apple sends when approving your app.

Like my previous app <a href="http://appnotifications.com">Push4</a>, it
combines all your RSS Feeds, Twitter, Facebook and Email into one app. It uses
the same backend Technology but I rewrote the app completely from the ground.
<a href="http://imore.com">iMore</a> wrote a <a
href="http://imore.com/faast-ios-gives-you-one-unified-social-and-rss-stream-rule-them-all">quick
review</a> about it and new users seem to love it.
 
It's available for Free on the AppStore with a 2 weeks Free Trial. I care about your
feedback, so why don't you give it a try and let me know?
