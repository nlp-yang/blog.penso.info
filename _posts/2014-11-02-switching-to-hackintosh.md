description: Switching to Hakintosh for my daily environment

TL;DR â€” **I bought standard PC hardware components and I'm waiting for its
delivery to install MacOSX and use this hackintosh as my daily development
setup.**

My currently daily computer is a a Mac mini mid-2011 I bought as I was waiting
for a new MacPro. At the time no one knew Apple would release the new *trash can
MacPro* and since I really wanted thunderbolt I didn't want to invest into the
existing MacPro who had not seen updates for a long time.

I got a Mac mini waiting for a new powerful computer, and an external raid5
FW800 disks for my photos (currently using about 3TB). That was a temporary
setup, but the temporary did last 4 years. A [Dell 30" screen died]({% post_url 2013-05-15-howto-repair-DELL %}) on the way (I fixed it myself later on) and I
got the 27" Thunderbolt Display. Going from 30" to 27" was actually harder than
I thought.

Recently the [iMac 5K](http://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/) was released,
with the new slower Mac Mini, and less expandable than before. I went to the
local applestore and while I was impressed by the screen quality, I wasn't
willing to spend as much as 3500 euros on the top line model (the cheapest one
is apparently only good for Safari browsing).

I have a very specific need: I want 5TB of disk space locally available, high
CPU and lots of RAM. For the disks I would have to go to a LaCie Raid5
thunderbolt disk, it adds about 1200 euros to my total cost. That means close
to 5000 euros to spend on a decent computer.

### Components

I've spent a few hours reading [online
forums](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/275011-mac-pro-mod-finished/)
and [articles](http://www.cultofmac.com/274210/hackintosh/) about hackintosh,
and ended up following [Tony's
advices](http://www.tonymacx86.com/446-building-customac-buyer-s-guide-october-2014.html).
My component list:

- [Antec P280 case](http://www.materiel.net/boitier-pc/antec-p280-73585.html)
- [Intel i7-4790K 4Ghz CPU](http://www.materiel.net/processeur-socket-1150/intel-core-i7-4790k-104741.html)
- [Noctua NH-U12S CPU Fan](http://www.materiel.net/radiateur-pour-processeur/noctua-nh-u12s-90711.html)
- [Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD7 Thunderbolt Mother Board](http://www.materiel.net/carte-mere-socket-1150/gigabyte-ga-z97x-ud7-th-108969.html)
- [MSI GeForce GTX 760 4GB Graphic Card](http://www.materiel.net/carte-graphique/msi-geforce-gtx-760-oc-4-go-n760-tf-4gd5-oc-95440.html)
- [Corsair RM650 Power](http://www.materiel.net/alimentation-pc/corsair-rm650-modulaire-650w-95665.html)
- [Samsung 840EVO SSD](http://www.materiel.net/ssd/samsung-serie-840-evo-250-go-94317.html)
- [Corsair 32GB RAM](http://www.materiel.net/barrette-memoire-pour-pc/corsair-vengeance-4-x-8-go-ddr3-pc12800-cas-10-73590.html)

For 40 euros extras the store builds the computer, and checks everything
works fine. It will be delivered without any OS and I can then proceed into
[installing
MacOSX](http://www.tonymacx86.com/445-unibeast-install-os-x-yosemite-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html).
Total cost: **1600.15 euros** for one of the most powerful computer.

I feel sad Apple is now selling computer [less
powerful](http://www.imore.com/seven-things-you-need-know-about-new-mac-mini)
than previous versions, and is *iPhoneifying* its computer line (meaning, not
expandable). This iMac 5K looks nice, but the graphic card isn't powerful
enough and I feel like my temporary Hackintosh setup will actually serves me
for a while.
