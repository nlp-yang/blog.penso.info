#### Read this first

I wrote this post because I was receiving emails from friends about my past
experience and wanted to gather all my advices in a single post.

I now receive more emails from readers than ever, at least a few per week,
asking me questions about getting a job in San Francisco. I love you to blog,
link, talk about this post, and if you really need to talk to me
[@fabienpenso](http://twitter.com/fabienpenso) is best. But while I would
*love* to answer everyone of you over email, I just can't.

However, if I receive the same questions over and over again, I'll amend this
post with more details. But please please please, don't expect me to answer
private emails about this subject.

This post also got featured on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767435) on #3 position. I suggest
reading the comments for further information. I'm also <a
href="/hire.html">available for consulting</a>.

#### My background

I'm a French citizen living in Paris, I moved to San Francisco in 2010 and
worked for [Causes](http://www.causes.com) for about a year, until I resigned
and left. I had previously traveled there twice, for a few months each time.
[Causes](http://www.causes.com) was a small company, and the dev team was even
as small as 4 Software Engineers at some point, but we had close to 150
millions users. You can read about what I wrote when I left [on
this blog post]({% post_url 2011-05-31-542-resigned-from-causes %}).

I’ve worked almost 15 years, I’m 34 years old but started very
early in my business career, after leaving the University at 18 which I had only joined
because I got rejected from a better school I wanted to go to. Overall, I
think starting my professional life early was the best move and the best thing
that happened to me. Today I focus on [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org)
& iOS development, and always enjoy being part of new projects.

Because of my connection to the French community and my past travels to San
Francisco, I sometimes get requests by email about the matter. I decided to
compile my replies within this post. Please note that applies to *Software
Engineers* and I can only compare to what I’ve previously known: French
companies.

#### Why going to San Francisco?

Mecca for Software Engineers, the only place in the World where the guy in front
at Starbucks has big chance to be Software developer. If you are an Engineer,
interested about Internet and startups: *this is the only place to be*. Working
in fashion? Go to NYC. Working in Software development? Go to SF. It's just
that simple.

You'll see an immense amazing positive atmosphere everywhere, people working
day time for a normal job and coding on evenings in coffee places, trying to
work on their latest idea. They might even raise a few millions dollars on it,
really.

#### Why I left?

I love culture, I love exhibitions, I love museums and art. Yes San Francisco
(and NYC of course) is better than any other American cities about that, but I
was still missing my Parisian way of life. After almost a year I felt it was
time for me to go back.

I love Paris as much as I hate Parisians[^1], and I had
enough of working full time for a startup; I wanted to go back. Nothing
fancy, lots of my friends love San Francisco and live there for a long time.

*And one day I might very well go back.*

#### Job Interviews

A French guy I knew, and I would have hired before, got rejected by me because
his technical skills were not good enough. But I only found out doing a *US*
style interview, a few years back I would probably have hired him.

Questions during recruitment interviews in San Francisco are way, way 
more technical. When you live in SF, you’re surrounded by Engineers,
and companies need to know how good you are compared to others. They don’t
always need an answer, and might just want to see how you think, how you
interact when having a problem and so on, but you will get tough questions.
Remember you’re not at home, and you have additional stress from the interview.
The interview might include pair programming for a few hours with one of the
employee, solving puzzles, and so on.

Questions could be writing a substring() function and being able to tell how
fast it runs using Big O notation (I knew nothing about this before coming, and
still got offers…), sorting arrays with specific sort methods, writing games,
etc. It will involves doing something in a limited amount of time, it will
require you to know coding, and I highly suggest you code for a few weeks
before applying if you’re not confident doing it at any time of the day without
notice.

*Read [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565924536.do) and prepare
yourself for your interviews.*

#### The recruitment process

Here are some common steps you might go through:

1. Skype call / Phone interview
2. Technical interviews with some team members, rarely more than 2 hours.
3. Longer technical interview
4. Meet the whole team

#### The team spirit

Interviews are much longer than I was used to, and the so called *team
spirit* is crucial. You must fit the spirit of the team you want to join. As an
example, I’ve been interviewed at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and went
through speaking to about 11 people during 2 full days (I think the entire
mobile team at the time), spending hours at their office and answering most of
the time the same questions (what have you done in the past, why do you want to
join us, etc). 

I got rejected because of a single guy in the team who didn't think I was a
fit. Quite surprising for me as I had developed specific iOS Twitter
applications, and worked with the Twitter API for a long time. I had
internal connections, early access to their streaming API, and even met [Ev
Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(entrepreneur\)) during
[Chirp](https://twitter.com/Chirp) because someone wanted to show him the
project I was working on[^2].

*Or maybe I got rejected because I was just too much of a dick.* 

The rejection email from Twitter was very formal, something like
*"thanks for coming by but we don't have something for you right now, good
luck"*. Spending 2 days of your time at a company to get such a short email is
apparently very common in the US, and when I was on the other side trying to
hire for [Causes](http://www.causes.com) someone told me it prevents the
candidate to sue you. Those emails have to be short and concise.

When rejecting candidates for my own company I wanted to tell them why I
rejected them, and how to improve, but I have been told not to do it, for legal
reason.

I will add than Twitter had a specific atmosphere compared to other so called
startups. The employees seem to be hired on more than skills, everyone at
their office is very much hipster like, beautiful looking, feeling super
confident and ready to kick it. Walking around Twitter sometimes almost feels
like walking within a TV show.

But being rejected by a team because you're not a fit doesn't mean you can't
try another within the same company, if the company is big enough (Apple,
Google, etc).

#### Referrals

Because I have a few years of experience, and a few projects than worked (the
most popular in France is probably the French website
[linuxfr.org](http://linuxfr.org) which had over 40 millions hits a month back in 2001, a few
dozen of thousands of users, and won the Linux Journal readers choice awards),
I get people asking me for Engineers to hire. In France my word would
almost be enough for someone to be hired, they get a few more questions
but people trust my judgment and hire the guy. In the US, my word would
not make a difference and the candidate still go through the whole
recruiting process. 

*In San Francisco referral helps, but won't get you a job.*

It took me quite a long time to understand this, but even with a very good
referral, you still go through the full hiring process, which is much
longer than the one we have in France. I believe the US way to be better, as
you can see how good and experienced is the candidate, even him being a friend
of a friend.

A French friend of mine I had referred to [Causes](http://www.causes.com) got
rejected at step one, even I told them I'd like him to be hired.

#### Being local

Before those “on site” interviews for jobs, you need to actually be in San
Francisco. My best advice is go to San Francisco for a few weeks, do some
sightseeing, enjoy the city and contact all the companies you want to work for
before coming. Try to have your days full of appointments and meet as many as
possible while being here. Many cool companies are hiring and always have a job
listing on their page. Send your resume, get in touch with them. 

Usually you’ll have phone screens first, then it could even be remote pair
programming but if your English isn’t perfect, I’d suggest just doing it from
San Francisco.

*Come visit, take a month off. Meet as many people as possible, first with
companies you don't care about so you get trained to US style interviews. Keep
the ones you really want to work for when you feel confident enough.*

#### Improve your chance to get a job

_Attitude_: You must be super positive, happy and bring more than just skills.
This isn't easy for French, they're more willing to complain for every change
you want to input than embrace them.

_Expertise_: Learn Ruby, iOS and use Agile methodology. If you believe into A/B
testing, Specs, TDD you probably have a better chance to get a job than if you
don't.

#### Recruiters

Avoid them like the plague, most companies I would love to work for avoid them
too. Get in touch with companies you want to work for, make them aware you're
looking for a position, and don't even bother to ask recruiters.

However if you do use recruiters, be aware than they sometimes get tens of
thousands of dollars if they find someone for an Engineer position. Someone
responsible for recruitment for a famous startup told me she would give me as
much as $20,000 if I found her someone who worked in the company for 6 months.
That's what she would have to pay a recruiter anyway, so she was happy to give
it to me.

*Sadly even for that amount I knew noone available*.

The only case you might be looking for recruiters is if you're looking for very
specific positions like CEO, but you're probably not reading this article if
you do.

#### The Salary

Back in 2011 I had $100k a year, that might seem a lot for you but it is not
that much in the Valley. I accepted because I had lot of stock options, they
took care of my VISA, and I just wanted to live in San Francisco for a while.
The cost of living is enormous and you'll probably have to pay at least $2,000
a month for a small studio. This is so ridiculous than you'll have to get
roommates like you're 20 years old, or live with a house owner who will put you
rules like not to invite your friends at home.

*San Francisco is now the most expensive city of the US for housing, more than
Manhattan.*

An intern working for a startup might get $80k a year, a Senior Engineer
probably at least $150k. Recruiting in San Francisco today is a nightmare, and
you're the Gold. I repeat, if you're a skilled Software Engineer: you're the
King everyone wants. *Make your rules* and write your story.

French will note US companies don't pay much tax on salaries like they do
in France, what could make you think is a lot of money isn't. Your French
salary costs 40% extra to your company, but not in San Francisco.

#### The VISA

The way you get your VISA changes all the time, what may be true today might be
untrue tomorrow. I was lucky to get a H1B, which seems to be one of the best
VISA to later apply for a Green Card.

This is a long process, and you'll have to go back home. You can not start
working while being in the US without a VISA, and you can't apply for a VISA
while being in the US on a Waiver VISA (the one you get when you come from a
list of specific countries). There is no efficient turnaround than I'm aware
of, you must go back home and wait for your VISA, but your company will
probably agree to have you work remote while it's being done. Your company will
pay a lawyer to deal with the Immigration ([USCIS](http://www.uscis.gov/)) and
you'll have to give the lawyer all the details about your diplomas, I even had
to find out the *grade per class* I had 5 years before, during my Master Degree
school year, and the class list I had during that year.

My only advice: Request a Green Card, don't wait.

Seriously, ask your company to apply for a Green Card for you from the first
day you start working for them.  Your Green Card has to be sponsored, and if
you own a Master Degree of Computer Sciences, the process might be much faster
than you'd expect. I heard stories from people getting it within a year.

The Green Card will give you the flexibility to work for anyone you want, it'll
give you way more freedom than anything, and if the company is willing to wait
for your VISA you're probably very well able to request this from them. They
know you'll have to stick with them until the Green Card process is done, and
maybe even 6 months more after.

*If you had one thing to remember after reading this blog post, it's requesting
a Green Card.*

#### When you're leaving

Foreigners, moving from a culture to another isn't easy, and you might very
well want to come back home. France and the US have more difference than you'd
expect, and I suggest to hold to it for at least a year. Big culture changes
require time to accommodate.

However you might decide to quit. If you do, remember how small is the Valley.
It is **very small**, believe me. Everyone talks to each other, and I've even
seen employees negotiating their leaving telling their CEO/company they'd give
them a nice referral if being asked, getting a good one in return.

It's such a nightmare to hire Software Engineers, noone wants you to spill on
the company telling everyone how bad your experience was. But don't burn your
bridges, you might want to come back to San Francisco or continue to work
remotely with the silicon valley community.

#### Some random notes

I would suggest French people not to work for French companies in the Valley,
unless you have no other choice. You won't learn as much from the American
culture, and the French company would probably not pay you as well as other
startups. They know you're used to be paid less, they'll pay you less.

*Why go half the way? Get the full experience and work for an American
startup.*

You'll have a blast.

#### Checklist

A list of things you should have before applying anywhere:

* A resume[^3]. Let's
	be honest, if you're good you don't need a resume. But having a nice one
	helps: *Spend a few hours on yours.*
* A Github account with published code.
* A website is nice, a blog is too, mostly if about technical stuff. You're
  reading mine.
* Know coding, languages often requested these days include
  Objective-C, Ruby, Python, Java (Android).
* A Linkedin page, startups use it a lot (and so do annoying recruiters).

Well this blog post became much longer than I expected, I hope you found it
useful. If you did, drop me a note at
